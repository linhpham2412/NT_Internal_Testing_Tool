| Specialist CT-MBT Certified Tester Model-Based Tester | The given workflow diagram describes the behavior of the ATM machine. It shows the transaction using ATM card function. After user inserts card, the ATM’s card reader will validate the card. If the card is not valid then the machine will eject the card. After the card is being read successfully, the ATM machine will ask for Pin. Then the user enters the Pin number and ATM machine will check Pin. If the Pin entered is not valid then the machine will reject the card. If the entered Pin is valid, then the machine further processes the transaction. After a successful transaction, the user can select between another transaction or finished the transaction. If the finished transaction is selected, the machine will eject the card.                                                                                                                                                                       | Images\\CT-MBT_image22.png                                                                                  | A reviewer of the model created four comments.

If you want to generate tests for a specific requirement or set of requirements, the MBT model can support generating test cases and to decide the priority of them.                       |                  | B. When requirements are linked with model elements, it becomes easier to analyze the impact of requirements changes                                                       | Y                | C.

Even if the interfaces are not yet stabilized, linking the defined functional requirements to MBT models can help to generate the automation test scripts.                |                  |         |                  |         |                  |         |                  |         |                  |         |                   |          |
